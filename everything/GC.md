If you're unreferenced, I delete you to make the earth cleaner!!!

Naive mark-and-sweep in action on a **heap** containing eight objects. Arrows represent object references. Circles represent the objects themselves. Objects #1, #2, #3, #4, and #6 are strongly referenced from the root set. On the other hand, objects #5, #7, and #8 are not strongly referenced either directly or indirectly from the root set; therefore, they are garbage.
